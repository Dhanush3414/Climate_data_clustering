# 🌍 Climate Data Clustering

This project applies **machine learning clustering techniques** on climate-related datasets to analyze patterns and group similar data points. The goal is to identify meaningful clusters in climate data that can provide insights for environmental research and decision-making.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implements **unsupervised learning algorithms** (KMeans, DBSCAN, MeanShift, PCA, t-SNE, etc.) on climate datasets.
- Uses **visualization techniques** (Elbow method, scatter plots, dimensionality reduction) to interpret clusters.
- Evaluates clustering results and discusses their implications in climate analysis.
